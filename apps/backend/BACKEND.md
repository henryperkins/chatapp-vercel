# Backend Documentation

## Overview

The backend of ChatApp Vercel-D is built using Next.js 13.5.2 with TypeScript, leveraging API Routes for serverless function deployment. It handles API requests, database operations, and integrates with external services like MongoDB and Pusher.

- **Output**: Confirmation of addition

### get_config.ts

- **Purpose**: Retrieves configuration settings
- **Method**: GET
- **Output**: Configuration object

### list_conversations.ts

- **Purpose**: Lists user conversations
- **Method**: GET
- **Output**: Array of conversation objects

### load_conversation/[conversation_id].ts

- **Purpose**: Loads a specific conversation
- **Method**: GET
- **Input**: Conversation ID (in URL)
- **Output**: Conversation details and messages

### reset_conversation.ts

- **Purpose**: Resets the current conversation
- **Method**: POST
- **Output**: Confirmation of reset

### search_conversations.ts

- **Purpose**: Searches through conversations
- **Method**: GET
- **Input**: Search query
- **Output**: Array of matching conversation snippets

### send_message.ts

- **Purpose**: Sends a new message and retrieves AI response
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: User message
- **Output**: AI response

### start_conversation.ts

- **Purpose**: Initiates a new conversation
- **Method**: POST
- **Output**: New conversation ID

### uploadd_file.ts (typo noted)

- **Purpose**: Handles file uploads for analysis
- **Method**: POST
- **Input**: File data
- **Output**: Analysis results

## Utilities

### auth.ts

- Handles JWT-based authentication
- Includes functions for token generation and verification

### azure.ts

- Integrates with Azure OpenAI Service
- Handles API calls for AI-generated responses

### helpers.ts

- Contains utility functions used across the backend
- Includes data processing and formatting functions

### middleware/cors.ts

- Implements CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware
- Configures allowed origins and methods

### mongodb.ts

- Manages MongoDB connection
- Provides functions for database operations

### pusher.ts

- Configures Pusher for real-time updates
- Includes functions for sending events to the frontend

## Types

### index.d.ts

- Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the backend
- Includes definitions for request/response objects, database models, etc.

## Database Schema

The backend uses MongoDB for data storage. Key collections include:

1. **Conversations**
   - `_id`: ObjectId
   - `userId`: String
   - `title`: String
   - `createdAt`: Date
   - `updatedAt`: Date

2. **Messages**
   - `_id`: ObjectId
   - `conversationId`: ObjectId (ref: Conversations)
   - `content`: String
   - `role`: String (user | assistant)
   - `createdAt`: Date

3. **FewShotExamples**
   - `_id`: ObjectId
   - `query`: String
   - `response`: String
   - `createdAt`: Date

## External Services Integration

### Azure OpenAI Service

- Used for generating AI responses
- Configured in `azure.ts`
- API calls are made in `send_message.ts`

### Pusher

- Used for real-time updates to the frontend
- Configured in `pusher.ts`
- Events are triggered in various API endpoints (e.g., `send_message.ts`)

## Error Handling

- Each API route includes try-catch blocks for error handling
- Errors are logged and appropriate HTTP status codes are returned
- Custom error messages are sent to the client for better debugging

## Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication is implemented
- Tokens are verified in each protected API route
- User information is extracted from the token for personalized responses

## Performance Considerations

- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing
- Caching mechanisms are implemented where appropriate
- Large response payloads are paginated

## Testing

- Jest is set up for unit and integration tests
- Each utility function and API route should have associated test files
- Mock data is used to simulate database and external service responses

## Deployment

The backend is configured for deployment on Vercel:
- Each API route is deployed as a serverless function
- Environment variables are managed through Vercel's dashboard

## Development Workflow

1. Implement new features or modify existing ones in the `pages/api/` directory
2. Update or add utility functions in the `utility/` directory as needed
3. Run tests locally: `npm run test`
4. Use `npm run dev` to test the API locally
5. Commit changes and push to the repository
6. Vercel will automatically deploy the changes

## Security Considerations

- Input validation is implemented for all API inputs
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits are conducted

## Monitoring and Logging

- Error logging is implemented for debugging
- Performance metrics are collected for optimization
- Usage statistics are tracked for analysis

## Future Improvements

- Implement GraphQL for more flexible querying
- Add more comprehensive input validation
- Enhance error handling and provide more detailed error messages
- Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Develop a more robust testing suite, including integration tests
- Optimize database queries for larger datasets
- Implement serverless background jobs for long-running tasks
